## Introduction

This project is about an Online Food Delivery System.  
It is designed to store and manage information related to customers, restaurants, food items, orders, delivery, and payments using a database.

The purpose of this project is to understand how database systems work in real-life applications.

---

## Objective

The main objective of this project is:

- To manage customer details
- To store restaurant and food information
- To record orders placed by customers
- To manage delivery information
- To store payment details

---

## Main Entities

The system has six main parts:

1. **Customer** – stores customer information like name, email, phone, and address.  
2. **Restaurant** – stores restaurant details.  
3. **Food Item** – stores food name, price, and category.  
4. **Order** – stores order details and is the main part of the system.  
5. **Delivery** – stores delivery person information.  
6. **Payment** – stores payment details for each order.

- One customer can place many orders.
- One restaurant can provide many food items.
- An order contains food items.
- Each order has one payment.
- One delivery person can deliver many orders.

## How the System Works

1. A customer places an order.
2. The order includes food from a restaurant.
3. The system stores order information.
4. A delivery person delivers the order.
5. The customer makes payment.
6. All data is saved in the database.

## Central Entity

The **Order** is the main part of the system because it connects customers, food, delivery, and payment together.

---

## Advantages

- Easy to manage data
- Helps track orders
- Reduces data repetition
- Useful for real-world applications

---

## Conclusion

This project shows how database concepts like tables, relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys can be used to create an Online Food Delivery System.

It helps in understanding how databases are used in real life.
